# Intro + Youtube Video

Hi, I'm Matt Rybin (aka Mateusz Rybinski)! A company asked me to do a coding task to show off my skills. I thought it was a good exercise using React and unit/component/e2e testing to create a multi-step form.

Here is the YouTube video explaining my solution in detail:

## Important notes

- This app uses TypeScript and Zod to check type correctness
- I don't use any libraries like React Router, React Query, xState, NextJS, or Zustand
- The core challenges are the Sidebar and the multi-step form. I don't test much outside of that as this project is just a demonstration.
- Packages have not been updated as it was outside the scope
- You were allowed to improve the design

# Front-end Recruitment Task

Welcome to our Front-end Recruitment task! Your challenge is to use the provided technology stack, mockups, and assets to recreate a wizard.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All steps presented in `_mockups` are implemented, assets from `_assets` are used in the implementation
- User is not able to proceed to the next step unless all required info has been filled in
- `_data/mock.json` is used to fill the select options (in step 2)
- User is able to verify all the info in the last step (only in read mode), before being able to submit it
- Minimum one component is covered with unit tests, all created tests pass

### Notes

- Implementation of mockups does not have to be pixel-perfect.
- All mockups can be found in the **\_mockups** directory.
- All assets can be found in the **\_assets** directory.
